## Why?

I've been building many projects lately (most of which I've given up on), and I've spent 99% of 
the time just buidling auth, and simple ui, relating to auth... then theres a 1% chance I even 
get to the main functionality of the site, because I just get so sick of the auth flow. 

So, I've decided to create a template for myself, using my favorite tools/libraries. These inlcude:

- NextJS 14
- Shadcn UI 
- Stripe
- Resend
- React Email
- Prisma
- Postgres DB (external ofc)

You can use this if you'd like to, and contributions are welcome.

Thanks!
