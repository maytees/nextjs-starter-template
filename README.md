## Why?

I've been building many projects lately (most of which I've given up on), and I've spent 99% of 
the time just buidling auth, and simple ui, relating to auth... then theres a 1% chance I even 
get to the main functionality of the site, because I just get so sick of the auth flow. 

So, I've decided to create a template for myself, using my favorite tools/libraries. These inlcude:

- NextJS 14
- Shadcn UI 
- Stripe
- Resend
- React Email
- Prisma
- Postgres DB (external ofc)

## What sets this apart from the others?

I want this template to be set apart from the others in terms of customizability.
Of course this is just a template and you can do whatever you would like with it -
but sometimes I may want a product image on the hero section and sometimes I wouldn't,
so I don't want to spend my time editing the Tailwind CSS in order to just add an image,
it's a waste of time.

***meaning***: the template landing page and dashboard will have options which you're able to 
switch out to your liking. Does this hero not fit your product? Try Hero #2!

You can use this if you'd like to, and contributions are welcome.

Thanks!
